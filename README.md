# Book Advisor
I am a huge fan of books, so I have been thinking how I usually choose a new book, and reflecting about that led me to an idea of building a simple recommendation system. This recommendaiton system is a Collaborative Filtering approach, based on goodreads [data](https://mengtingwan.github.io/data/goodreads#datasets) and uses the authors dataset, books dataset and the interactions dataset along the user_id dataset to serve as a link between the interactions dataset and books dataset. Finally, I am currently storing all the processed data in a S3 Bucket on AWS and building an app using Streamlit.
